Of course it would not be so easy to reach Neptune.
I’ll traverse his entry maze so I may speak to him openly.

Dear Neptune,
As ruler of all the seas and creatures in it, 
I beg you to hear our pleas.
The narwhals have started encroaching on our feeding grounds!
War will be declared if they continue to trespass.
We turn to you for guidance in these tense and trying times.
Plz help, The Orcas
Well, well. Looks like there’s a bit of strife within Neptune’s kingdom.
I wonder if I’ll discover anything else while I’m finding my way.

My Lord,
Our pods are being chased away from high northern waters.
The shifting ice floes make it too dangerous to raise young.
Help is politely requested,  The Narwhals

~ A weather report ~
“Ice in the north is breaking apart at an alarming rate. 
Many species in the area have been affected. 
Could this be caused by...the rising temperatures of the sea?”
