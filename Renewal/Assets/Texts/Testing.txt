If I can rekindle my relationship with Jupiter,
I will (hopefully) be able to rejoin the Planetary Council!

Dearest Europa,
Your beauty surpasses that of my wife. 
Be wary that she not catch you in the open. 
She must never know of our connection. 
~ Your Golden King
This sounds...scandalous. I..Iâ€™m not sure what exactly I should do with this...

My Darling Danae,
She is becoming suspicious.
Secrecy is of the utmost importance.
We will meet once again when she is busy with other affairs. 
~ Your Brilliant Monarch

My Cherished Alcmena,
Once again I am blown away by your exquisiteness and elegance.
There is no comparison in all the heavens.
Why, even Venus might be envious of your grace!
~ Your Gallant, Valiant, Lion-hearted Prince of Lightning

You found yourself a lucky penny!
